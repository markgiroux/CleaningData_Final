### Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset  
### Updated 19-Jul-2017, by Mark Giroux  
###  Contains updates to the original README (original below)

## === Experiment Process : what/how data was collected (from original readme.txt, below) ==== 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. "

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

For each record it is provided: 
 - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
 - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
 - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
 - Its activity label.
 - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.



## === Project Description ====

Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
    http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

### For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- features_info.txt: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- features.txt: List of all features.

- activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': the body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

### Notes: 
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is A row on the text file.
